# Project Status Updates

This document tracks the weekly progress, challenges, and next steps for the Behavioral Authentication System project.

---

## Week 1: July 8, 2025 - July 14, 2025 (Project Phase Start)

### Progress Made:

*   **Project Setup:** Initial repository setup and environment configuration completed.
*   **Backend Core:** Verified the core Python backend structure, including `websocket_server.py`, `behavioral_analyzer.py`, and `feature_extractor.py`.
*   **Frontend Core:** Reviewed the frontend structure, including `behavioral-collector.js`.
*   **Dashboard Implementation:** Developed a basic web-based dashboard (`index.html`, `dashboard.js`, `style.css`) to visualize real-time risk scores.
*   **Frontend Server:** Configured and ran a Node.js/Express server to serve the frontend assets.
*   **Backend-Frontend Integration (Initial):** Established WebSocket communication between the frontend data collector and the backend analysis engine.
*   **Dependency Management:** Ensured all Python and Node.js dependencies are correctly installed and managed within virtual environments.
*   **Initial Model Training:** Implemented dummy data generation and initial model training on backend startup to ensure the system can function without pre-existing models.

### Challenges Encountered:

*   **Disk Space Issues:** Faced initial challenges with insufficient disk space during backend dependency installation, which was resolved.
*   **Frontend Server Port Conflict:** Encountered `EADDRINUSE` errors when starting the frontend server due to lingering processes, which required manual termination.
*   **Frontend Asset Loading:** Resolved `404 Not Found` and MIME type errors for `behavioral-collector.js` by correctly configuring the Express server to serve the `collector` directory.
*   **WebSocket Connection Stability:** Debugged and fixed issues with the WebSocket connection being in a `CLOSING` or `CLOSED` state, ensuring data is only sent when the connection is `OPEN`.
*   **Missing Backend Module:** Identified and installed the missing `websockets` Python module, which was preventing the backend server from starting correctly.
*   **Untrained ML Models:** Realized the ML models were not trained, leading to static risk scores. Implemented a temporary solution to train models with dummy data on startup.
* WebSocket connection stability issues.
* Missing websockets Python module.
* ML models not trained, leading to static risk scores (temporarily resolved with dummy data training on startup).

### Next Steps for Week 2:

*   **Refine Dummy Data Generation:** Improve the dummy data generation to be more representative for better initial model training.
*   **Implement User Authentication Flow:** Begin implementing a basic user authentication system to manage individual user profiles more effectively.
*   **Database Integration (Initial):** Start integrating a simple database (e.g., SQLite for development) to persist user profiles and collected behavioral data.
*   **Enhance Dashboard UI/UX:** Improve the visual appeal and user experience of the dashboard, potentially adding more detailed visualizations.
*   **Error Handling & Logging:** Enhance error handling and logging across both frontend and backend for easier debugging and monitoring.
*   **Begin Browser Extension Development:** Start scaffolding the browser extension to collect data from external websites.

## Current State Note:

Encountered a persistent `TypeError: handler() missing 1 required positional argument: 'path'` in the `websockets` library, despite attempts to fix the handler function in `websocket_server.py`. This suggests a potential issue with the `websockets` library installation or the virtual environment. A clean reinstallation of the virtual environment and dependencies is recommended to resolve this.
